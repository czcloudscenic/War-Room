# Roadmap — Numbered Fixes

Numbered punch-list. Each fix may touch multiple files/nodes; numbers cross-reference the badges in the interactive HTML map.

## Order to attack (recommended)

1. **#4** — Split agent-action.js (1,317 lines) into per-handler files. Same mechanical shape as the App.jsx split Codex just landed → ideal Codex candidate. Brief = `agent-action.js` line ranges + dirty-WIP exclusion list + CODEX_NOTES.md as the report. (Fix #9 was closed-by-removal 2026-05-26 PM — the WIP files are no longer in the tree.)
2. **#12** — Back OpsBoard with a DB-backed `tasks` table. ~1hr; small migration + UI rewrite. Schema sketch already in this file.
3. **#13** — Per-user client assignments table (now unblocked by OAuth + `client_users`).
4. **#14** — Decouple `seed.content.js` from VitalLyfe (or remove — DB is authoritative now).

## All fixes

### ✅ #1 — Re-enable Google OAuth + auth gate — CLOSED 2026-05-25
- **Where:** `src/App.jsx` (setupSession + render branches)
- **Closed by:** `8e5095e` (gate + admin RLS) + `307b64f` (dedupe setupSession) + `d0acec3` (4s stuckGuard hotfix)
- **What landed:** Four-way branch — admin / approved external client / pending invite (realtime unlock) / unknown blocked. Google OAuth verified end-to-end.

### ✅ #2 — Split App.jsx into smaller components — CLOSED 2026-05-26 (Codex)
- **Where:** `src/App.jsx` (1,676 → 1,342 lines) + new `src/ui/routes/`
- **What landed:** Six route components extracted (DashboardRoute, AgentsRoute, ContentRoute, TrackerRoute, TaskboardRoute, SopsRoute) on branch `codex/grunt-2026-05-26`, then merged onto main. App.jsx still owns state — routes are dumb presentation taking props. Highest prop count: TrackerRoute at 13. Build passed after each of the 7 commits (one per route + a notes summary).

### ✅ #3 — Brain Move 1: Cortex wiring (per-client agent voice) — CLOSED 2026-05-26
- **Where:** `netlify/functions/agent-action.js` + `src/core/memory.js` + `supabase/migrations/20260526_seed_vitallyfe_brand_voice.sql`
- **What landed:**
  1. `getBrandContext(client_id)` helper at `agent-action.js:94` fetches `clients.name` + `clients.brand_voice_md` via Supabase REST, falls back gracefully when client_id is null or brand_voice_md is empty.
  2. `exports.handler` calls it once per request, passes `brand` to every handler.
  3. 12 prompt sites refactored to interpolate `${brand.name}` and `${brand.voice}` — was 5 in the original audit, expanded to all of: muse_write_content, overseer_scan, sean_briefing, sam_health, scrappy_research, scrappy_muse_collab, artgrid_scout, muse_generate_calendar, muse_from_brief, scrappy_hook_analysis, cid_build_brief, cid_ab_variations, muse_ig_ideas.
  4. Dynamic `#${brand.name}` hashtag templates replace `#VitalLyfe` in 3 JSON-schema example strings.
  5. Dead `seedMuseMemory()` in `memory.js` removed entirely (zero callers).
  6. VitalLyfe seeded via SQL migration so behavior is identical pre/post for the existing client.
- **Verified:** Muse generated on-brand caption against VitalLyfe in dev — cinematic, calm, purposeful structure intact.
- **Follow-up:** Fix #3.1 below — `cid_library.vitallyfe_adaptation` column name still references VitalLyfe.

### ✅ #3.1 — Rename cid_library.vitallyfe_adaptation → client_adaptation — CLOSED 2026-05-26
- **Where:** `supabase/migrations/20260526_cid_library_rename_adaptation.sql` + `netlify/functions/agent-action.js:959-961`
- **What landed:** Idempotent `do $$ ... end $$` block that checks `information_schema.columns` before renaming. Three insert sites in `scrappy_hook_analysis` updated. Header comment refreshed.
- **Out-of-band:** SQL run in Supabase by user before code push so prod doesn't 400 on the new column name.

### #4 — Split agent-action.js
- **Where:** `netlify/functions/agent-action.js` (1,317 lines, verified 2026-05-26 PM)
- **Steps:** Move each of the 16 handlers into its own file (e.g. `netlify/functions/agent-action/handlers/muse_write_content.js`). Keep `agent-action.js` as a router only — preserves `requireUser` + rate-limit gates + `getBrandContext` + `logAgentEvent` wrappers at the top level.
- **Pattern:** Mirror Codex's Fix #2 App.jsx split. Brief Codex with the line ranges for each handler block + dirty-WIP out-of-scope list + `CODEX_NOTES.md` as the report file. One commit per handler extraction; build passes after each.

### ✅ #5 — Caller auth on all functions — CLOSED 2026-05-25
- **Where:** `netlify/functions/{chat,agent-action,notify,apify-scrape,unsplash}.js`
- **Closed by:** Commit `2a9c9c1` — shared helper `netlify/functions/_lib/requireUser.js` validates Supabase JWT. Either @cloudscenic.com admin OR approved `client_users` row required.
- **Pattern landed:** Bearer-token + JWT lookup at `/auth/v1/user`, then client_users allowlist check. (Note: `cid-scrape.js` was later removed entirely 2026-05-26 PM — dead code.)

### ✅ #6 — Per-client Slack routing — CLOSED 2026-05-25
- **Where:** `netlify/functions/notify.js` L157-162
- **Closed by:** Commit `702f867`. New `clients.slack_webhook_url` column. `notify.js` prefers it when `client_id` is on the payload; falls back to global `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`. Edit Client modal exposes the field under "Optional integrations".

### ✅ #7 — Per-client n8n webhook routing — CLOSED 2026-05-26
- **Where:** `netlify/functions/notify.js`
- **What landed:** Single Supabase fetch pulls both `slack_webhook_url` and `n8n_webhook_url` from the client row (was two roundtrips after Fix #6). Each falls back to its global env var when the client has no override. Pattern matches commit `702f867` plus the consolidation.

### ✅ #8 — Delete `src/agents/` dead code — CLOSED 2026-05-26
- **What landed:** `rm -rf src/agents/`. 8 files / 96 lines removed. Build passed clean.

### ✅ #9 — Ship or delete Higgsfield — CLOSED 2026-05-26 PM (by removal)
- **Where:** `src/apps/higgsfield/HiggsfieldStudio.jsx` + `netlify/functions/higgsfield.js` (both removed); `src/apps/apps.config.js` + `src/utils/constants.js` (verified clean — no CREATIVE section, no Higgsfield nav entry).
- **What landed:** Files removed from the working tree; never were in git on `main` (verified via `git ls-tree -r origin/main | grep higgs` → empty). Local HEAD = origin/main at `19e7f02`.
- **If Higgsfield ships later:** treat it as a fresh feature commit. All five touchpoints (UI + function + `apps.config.js` entry + `constants.js` CREATIVE section + App.jsx import/render) must land in one commit, plus the `HIGGSFIELD_ACCESS_TOKEN` env in Netlify. Don't reconstitute the WIP.

### ✅ #10 — Write `content_items` migration — CLOSED 2026-05-26
- **Where:** `supabase/migrations/20260526_content_items_baseline.sql`
- **What landed:** Full 25-column schema, FK to `clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, `content_items_client_idx`, RLS enabled, 3 policies captured faithfully (2 admin + 1 wide-open temp). Idempotent: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` + `CREATE POLICY` so it can be applied against the existing prod DB or a fresh dev DB without error.
- **Surfaced security debt:** the legacy `"Allow all for now"` policy survived the 2026-05-25 anon cleanup. Migration header flags it loudly; DROP statement teed up at bottom for Fix #10.1.

### ✅ #10.1 — Drop content_items wide-open policy — CLOSED 2026-05-26 (code shipped)
- **Where:** `supabase/migrations/20260526_content_items_client_rls.sql`
- **What landed:** Two scoped policies for `client_users`:
  - `clients read scoped content_items` (SELECT) — using an `exists` subquery against `client_users` with `lower(email)` match + `status='approved'` + `client_id` equality
  - `clients update scoped content_items` (UPDATE) — same row qualifier, plus `with check` that prevents re-parenting a row to a different client_id
  - INSERT and DELETE remain admin-only
- **Then drops** the legacy `"Allow all for now"` policy.
- **Apply against live DB:** run `20260526_content_items_client_rls.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor. Anon callers should return 0 content_items rows after. Test admin + Natalia paths before considering it verified.

### ✅ #11 — Dynamic-import pdfjs-dist — ALREADY SHIPPED (pre-2026-05-26)
- **Where:** `src/apps/brief-gen/BriefGenPage.jsx:7`
- **What's there:** `const pdfjsLib = await import('pdfjs-dist')` inside `extractPdfText`. Vite output confirms pdfjs is in its own 405 KB chunk (`pdf-*.js`), not bundled into the main index. Closed in docs 2026-05-26 — the stale "main bundle is 777 KB, bulk is pdfjs" arch-map finding was wrong.

### #12 — Back OpsBoard with a DB table
- **Where:** `src/ui/dashboard/OpsBoard.jsx` + new `supabase/migrations/<date>_tasks.sql`
- **Schema sketch:**
  ```sql
  create table tasks (
    id bigserial primary key,
    client_id uuid references clients(id) on delete cascade,
    title text not null,
    assignee text,
    column text check (column in ('backlog','in_progress','completed')),
    position int,
    created_at timestamptz default now()
  );
  ```

### #13 — Per-user client assignments
- **Where:** New `supabase/migrations/<date>_user_clients.sql`
- **When:** Now unblocked (OAuth is live + `client_users` table exists). Could be folded into `client_users` as a multi-row pattern instead of a new table.
- **Schema:** `(user_id, client_id, role)` — controls which clients each Cloud Scenic team member sees.

### #14 — Decouple seed.content.js from VitalLyfe
- **Where:** `src/data/seed.content.js`
- **Options:**
  - Per-client seedable (read `seed.content.<slug>.js` based on currentClient)
  - Or just remove it — data lives in DB now, fallback is obsolete.

### ✅ #15 — Auto-recover from supabase-js auth-lock errors — CLOSED 2026-05-26
- **Where:** `src/App.jsx` stuckGuard callback
- **What landed:** When the 4s stuckGuard fires, the callback now:
  1. Sets a one-shot `sessionStorage["vantus_auth_recovery_attempted"]` flag to prevent reload loops.
  2. Iterates `localStorage` and removes only keys matching `/^sb-.*-auth-token/` or `^supabase\.auth` — preserves `vantus_agent_hists`, `vantus_current_client_id`, apps prefs, etc.
  3. Calls `location.reload()` to break any in-flight `navigator.locks` mutexes.
  4. On the reloaded tab, the `SIGNED_IN`/`INITIAL_SESSION` handler clears the recovery flag so the mechanism can fire again next time.
  5. If stuckGuard fires a second time (recovery flag already set), falls through to login screen cleanly.
- **Manual workaround retired:** `localStorage.clear(); location.reload()` no longer needed for this class of failure.

## Cross-cutting work

### ✅ Drop temporary anon RLS policies — DONE 2026-05-25
All 5 temp anon policies dropped in `supabase/migrations/20260525_drop_temp_anon_policies.sql` (commit `852d915`). Admin-only RLS enforced across `agent_events`, `notifications`, `clients`, and the `client-logos` storage bucket via `auth.jwt()->>'email' like '%@cloudscenic.com'`.

### Rotate Supabase admin passwords (when convenient)
- **Why:** `Cloudai25%` (former SETUP_PASSWORD) is in git history. Becomes irrelevant once Google OAuth is the only path in.
- **Who:** `cz@cloudscenic.com`, `dv@cloudscenic.com`, `ss@cloudscenic.com`
- **Where:** Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Users → "Send password recovery"
- **Status:** Lower urgency now that OAuth is the only used login path — but password login technically still works.

### ✅ Security headers + CORS + rate limits — CLOSED 2026-05-26
- **What landed:**
  - `_lib/requireUser.js` exports `cors(event)` — per-request origin matching against an allowlist regex (`usevantus\.com` + `(deploy-preview-*--)?majestic-cassata-aa16e9.netlify.app`). All 6 functions rewritten to use it. `Vary: Origin` header included.
  - `_lib/rateLimit.js` — in-memory sliding window. Wired into `/api/chat` (30/min/user) and `/api/agent-action` (60/min/user). Cold starts reset — acceptable defense for now.
  - `netlify.toml` adds HSTS preload, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, and a tight CSP whitelisting only the real external origins.
